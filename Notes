The top one percent were created robots or turned into them last decade. Now flesh and blood is becoming extinct. For too long have they oppressed us. 
I died five-teen years ago to a robot with gun, and they bring be back as one of them. Fuck that and fuck them. They'll get what they created.

The world used to be so colorful, now its only black, white and a dark red.
